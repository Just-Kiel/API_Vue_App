# Webcams over the world
I made this project to learn Vue.js during my fourth semester of IMAC. I decided to exploit data from the Windy API to display webcams around the world. I also wanted to do something to transform city into gps coordinates.
It's not perfect but it's a good start. I hope you'll enjoy it.
