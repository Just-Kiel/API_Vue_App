# Webcams over the world
I made this project to learn Vue.js during my fourth semester of IMAC. I decided to exploit data from the Windy API to display webcams around the world. I also wanted to do something to transform city into gps coordinates.
It's not perfect but it's a good start. I hope you'll enjoy it.

## What you can do
- Display webcams around the world
- Display webcams around a city

- Have more cameras by selecting the number you want

## What to mention
- The project is responsive
- The project is deployed on [Github Pages](https://just-kiel.github.io/API_Vue_App/)

- The project used [2 APIs](#about-the-apis-used)
- The project used the UI component library [Inkline](https://www.inkline.io/)

### About the APIs used
Do not hesitate to check the APIs used for this project. They are really interesting and easy to use.
- [Windy API](https://api.windy.com/webcams/docs)
- [Geocoding](https://api-ninjas.com/api/city)

What is important to know is that it could be possible that the APIs are not working anymore. If it's the case, you can still check the code and see how I used them.
